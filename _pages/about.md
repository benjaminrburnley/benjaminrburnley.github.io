I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Government at Georgetown University](https://government.georgetown.edu/). I also hold a Master in Public Policy from the [McCourt School of Public Policy](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/) at Georgetown University and an M.S. in [Media and Communication](https://www.mtsu.edu/program/media-and-communication-m-s/) from Middle Tennessee State University.

My primary research considers how political communication on the internet and how digital communication platforms affect public opinion and political behavior. 
 Iâ€™ve explored these questions by looking at how political elites use social media, how political institutions, like the U.S. Congress, navigate digital content creation,the political beliefs of correctors of online misinformation, and how public policy is communicated online. More broadly I am interested in substantive questions involving public policy, Congress, political behavior, public opinion, technology policy, and the U.S. South. I primarily approach these questions using computational methods such as machine learning and natural language processing. 

Prior to academia, I was a professional musician and split time between Nashville and Atlanta. I am a member of the [Society for American Baseball Research](https://sabr.org/) and run a very competetive Fantasy Premier League ([here's our current leaderboard](https://benjaminrburnley.github.io/FPL/)). In my free time, I am a runner, a vinyl collector, and an amateur birder.x

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Government at Georgetown University](https://government.georgetown.edu/). I also hold a Master in Public Policy from the [McCourt School of Public Policy](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/) at Georgetown University and an M.S. in [Media and Communication](https://www.mtsu.edu/program/media-and-communication-m-s/) from Middle Tennessee State University. I am grateful to be advised by [Leticia Bode](https://lbode.wordpress.com), [Michael Bailey](https://michaelbailey.georgetown.domains/), [Michele Swers](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RbbCAAS/michele-swers), and [Jonathan Ladd](https://www.jonathanmladd.com/). 

My research considers how political communication on the internet and digital platforms affect public opinion and political behavior. 
 Iâ€™ve explored these questions by examining how political elites use social media, how political institutions -- like the U.S. Congress -- navigate digital content creation, the political beliefs of correctors of online misinformation, and when they communicate about public policy. More broadly, I am interested in substantive questions involving public policy, Congress, the media, political behavior, public opinion, technology policy, and the U.S. South. I primarily approach these questions using computational methods such as machine learning and natural language processing.

I am currently a replication assistant for [*Political Science Research and Methods*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods). During my time at Georgetown I've also worked as an MDI Scholar and graduate research assistant at the [Massive Data Institute](https://mdi.georgetown.edu/). I served my fellow graduate students as the president of the Georgetown Graduate Association of Political Science for two terms.

Prior to academia, I was a professional musician and split time between Nashville and Atlanta. I am a member of the [Society for American Baseball Research](https://sabr.org/) and run a very competetive [Fantasy Premier League](https://benjaminrburnley.github.io/FPL/). In my free time, I am a runner, a vinyl collector, and an amateur birder. I currently live in Arlington, Virginia, with my wife Kaitlin and our daughter Emerson.

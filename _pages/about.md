I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Government at Georgetown University](https://government.georgetown.edu/). I also hold a Master in Public Policy from the [McCourt School of Public Policy](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/) at Georgetown University and an M.S. in [Media and Communication](https://www.mtsu.edu/program/media-and-communication-m-s/) from Middle Tennessee State University.

My research is interested in political communication on the internet and how digital communication platforms affect public opinion and political behavior. Iâ€™ve explored these questions by looking at how political elites use social media, how political institutions, like the U.S. Congress, navigate digital content creation, the political beliefs of correctors of online misinformation, and how individuals who spend a lot of time online engage with the political system. I am interested in analyzing these questions using computational methods such as machine learning and natural language processing. 

Prior to academia, I was a professional musician and split time between Nashville and Atlanta. I have lived in and around the American South my entire life and am committed to making it a better, more inclusive place that celebrates its diversity of culture and people. In my free time, I enjoy running, playing music, and watching baseball and soccer.

# Analysis of Gerrymander in Florida
[Project Here](https://benjaminrburnley.github.io/ppol670_final/)
A project with colleages at the McCourt School of Public Policy looking at how the 2020 redistricting of the state of Florida impacted voting in the state. We wanted to know how the partisan gerrymandering of the state impacted both voting patterns and representation in the following election. Using the [Redistricting Data Hub](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/) API, we pulled spatial data for each of the congressional districts as well as election results and Census demographics. We then looked to see how many precincts that were redrawn into a new district saw a change in which political party represented them in Congress after the 2020 election. We also used a random forest model to analyze which features of a congressional district best predicted whether they were redrawn.

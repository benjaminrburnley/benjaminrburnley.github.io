## Dissertation: *Tweeters and Leaders: How Congress Uses Twitter to Gain Power*
My dissertation project looks at how members of Congress use Twitter (now X) to achieve their goals. The project is primarily interested in members of Congress who lack institutional power and turn to the affordances of Twitter to increase their status within Congress. The first chapter looks at highly engaged MCs, their demographics and how they compare to party leaders in terms of what and how they communicate. The second explores digital content creation in Congress through in-depth interviews with MCs, digital directors, and communications staff. The final chapter examines whether highly active MCs are better at accomplishing traditionally conceived goals in Congress like winning reelection, making public policy, gaining institutional power, getting media coverage, and raising money.
